This is where I write.

When I am not writing, I work as the Mobile Lead at [Buffer][buffer]. We are a fully remote company - managing across timezones and remote work are in my day to day. I love thinking about how to work better together, especially as the role of the manager evolves with remote work. 

I also **love coffee** - really love it!

If you find my writing useful, tell me about it and reach out. 

If you are interested in speaking, the Speaking page is a good place to start. Otherwise just send me an email - I am always happy to chat.
